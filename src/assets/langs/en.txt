Chinese trade brands are actively introducing artificial intelligence into marketing
Artificial intelligence is being successfully implemented in a wide variety of industries around the world, and China is at the forefront of this technological revolution. The discussion of new, not yet fully disclosed neural network capabilities has become one of the key topics at the International Consumer Goods Exhibition in China. Representatives of trade brands are actively exploring the potential of artificial intelligence in the field of marketing. Our correspondent will continue the topic.
Raul Pardeilhan is the face of several global luxury brands. The native of Argentina, widely known in acting and modeling circles, has been working in China for 13 years. He recently settled on Hainan Island.
Actor and model Raul Pardeilhan: "I will turn 42 next month. There are many interesting offers on Hainan for people like me. For mature, accomplished people who have more opportunities to buy an expensive car, yacht, go play golf."
Now, for those who are engaged in advertising and modeling, everything is much more complicated than before. Artificial intelligence can create an image of a dream on its own. Raul decided to fight for the opportunity to stay in the profession.
Actor and model Raul Pardailhan: "I decided to team up with those who understand the work of neural networks. I am interested in using not only my external data, but also my mental abilities. I already speak Chinese, but I'm going to use artificial intelligence to translate my videos into a variety of languages."
Fashion brands such as Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, Coach have already begun to use the capabilities of artificial intelligence.
Coach China President Liliana Lucioni: "Artificial intelligence is a new productivity tool that we use in our marketing campaign, a new way of working that allows us to be more accurate in forecasting the market, better understand our customers and create a strong and successful brand story."
Artificial intelligence can detect consumer trends and popularity of certain products in advance, visualize data to create individual content. All this is to attract an audience and increase sales. There is no shortage of data collection in China to make artificial intelligence smarter. But the main task is to use the data obtained, strictly adhering to ethical standards.
Fan Wei, co-managing partner of the Chinese Institute of Artificial Intelligence Deloitte: "How to create an artificial intelligence that is trustworthy so that its behavior is monitored? There are several points here. First, the government needs to introduce standard regulation. We see that the leadership of most countries, including the Chinese government, are doing this. It is necessary to introduce clear rules in our industry as well: what data should I disclose, what should I give up, what protective barriers should I build when using this technology."
The discussion on how to draw the line between creative imagination and a false representation of reality will continue for a long time. In this new technology race, it is important to remember that artificial intelligence, for all its perfection, only performs the creative task assigned to it by man. Talent, work and creativity are still valued.

The international exhibition in the field of fashion and textiles TEXPO 2024 is being held in Bishkek
Bishkek gathered hundreds of world leaders of the garment and textile industry at the TEXPO 2024 forum and exhibition. The main objectives of the event are to strengthen ties, exchange experience and enter new foreign markets for representatives of the textile and fashion sectors. Entrepreneurs and manufacturers from 17 countries, including China and Russia, as well as countries in Europe and Central Asia, took part in the exhibition.
The Kyrgyz garment industry is experiencing a new round of development. Many enterprises in the country are actively investing in modern equipment that will allow them to strengthen their positions in the global market and improve the quality of their products. This is one of those garment factories that keeps up with the times.
Founder of the Kyrgyz women's clothing brand Bazargul Samieva: "We have installed the latest intelligent sewing equipment from China. Chinese specialists train our employees to work on it. There are no analogues of such equipment in Central Asia. Such an automated process will allow us to significantly increase production capacity and expand the range of products. We are scaling up production in order to enter the international market."
Helping Kyrgyz manufacturers enter the global market and sign contracts with foreign partners is one of the main tasks of the TEXPO 2024 international exhibition, which is taking place today in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.
CGTN's own correspondent, Russian Zarina Saifudinova: "The exhibition brought together manufacturers, distributors, importers, exporters, sellers and buyers from many countries, including China, Russia, European and Central Asian countries. Participants have the opportunity not only to present their products and services at the exhibition site, but also to take part in intensive business events such as a business forum, workshops and B2B meetings."
Hundreds of representatives of the garment industry discussed current trends and future prospects of the industry. The largest delegation came from Russia, consisting of shopkeepers and showrooms, buyers and managers of marketplaces.
Semyon Pimenov, founder of the women's clothing brand, Russia: "Kyrgyz production is attractive primarily for two things. Firstly, it is close, we are in the same customs union, you can quickly transfer, you can pay in rubles. This is the first one. And the second is such an ideological closeness."
There are about 3 thousand garment factories operating in Kyrgyzstan, which sew products for export worth more than $ 150 million. According to data from last year, more than 90% of women's outerwear imported to Russia came from Kyrgyzstan. The forum provides an opportunity for entrepreneurs to establish new supplies.
Ilya Garmyshev, representative of Tolmach Toys, Russia: "We just stopped by a factory yesterday. They have about 300 seamstresses, they are ready to close our volumes. Tomorrow they will show us the samples that they rejected. We will probably decide to work with them if we agree on a price."
In 2023, Kyrgyzstan's exports to Russia amounted to more than 22 million pieces of clothing. The increase in the volume of deliveries in 5 positions is especially noticeable, such as women's and men's knitwear, blouses, underwear and T-shirts.
Minister of Economy and Commerce of the Kyrgyz Republic Daniyar Amangeldiev: "Over the past 4 years alone, the growth rate of our industry has been about 2-3 percent. By the end of 2024, we assume that the growth rate of the light industry will be around 20%."
The growth of orders implies the development of production. Therefore, the forum attracted the attention of manufacturers from China. They presented fabrics, accessories and the latest industrial equipment at the insert.
Textile manufacturer, China Xu Xinjie: "I brought a map with samples of fabrics that we produce. For example, women's and men's office suits can be sewn from these fabrics. These are suitable for school uniforms. Our fabrics are light and comfortable."
Representative of the sewing equipment manufacturing company, China Li Na: "We have brought modern sewing equipment to Kyrgyzstan. All devices are adapted to the Russian language, which makes it easier to learn and work on our equipment. We know that the fashion and textile industry is developing well in the country. On the second day, agreements were reached with Kyrgyz garment manufacturers on the supply of our products."
Over the past 20 years, the textile and clothing industry of Kyrgyzstan has entered the top five sectors of the economy. Kyrgyzstan has become a record holder in the EAEU in the field of light industry. This is due to the fact that the quality of manufactured products is getting better every year.
